                    <p>This heatmap was used to visualize the relationship between pitch type, one of the features we passed into the model, and hit type, which was used when deciding if a hit was favorable for the pitcher as our model output.

                        including true positives, false positives, true negatives, 
                        and false negatives. Here, true indicates that the pitch was 
                        favorable to the pitcher, and false indicates that it was not 
                        favorable. Through this, we can see that our model had an 87% 
                        accuracy, though the dataset was also skewed in favor of true.
